# Dog-park-simulator
Just a game where you're a dog, sorry if my organisation sucks

This is pretty much just a game I made because I was bored, it uses pygame and some other libraries
Basically you have to move a dog around and interact with other dogs to win
It's still a pretty big work in progress so it's likely to take a while ngl 
Sorry for anyone actually wanting to play it yet it kinda sucks so I'll update it over time
