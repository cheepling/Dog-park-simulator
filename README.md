# Dog-park-simulator
Just a game where you're a dog, sorry if my organisation sucks

This is pretty much just a game I made because I was bored, it uses pygame and some other libraries

Basically you have to move a dog around and interact with other dogs to win, I'll attach a mechanics file if I can

It's still a pretty big work in progress so it's likely to take a while to finish

I'll post progress updates here :D
